# Mern_Book-Search-Engine

Description: In this application, I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows the user to create a Username and Password or log in if already existing and search for their favorite books and save them to a queue or delete them as needed.

Installation: if running locally, clone down from Github in VScode.  Open terminal and run NPM i (at the root and within client and server).  You can then run NPM Run Develop to kick off the application.  Alternatively you can visit the heroku link below to access.

Usage: to use, first create a user by clicking on sign up in the top right corner.  This requires password validation to meet requirements as well as a username and email address.  Next you can find the book search window to search for your favorite classic books.  Once you find the book of your choosing, simply click, Save Book at the bottom to save it to your Saved Books queue.  The button will indicate if successful.  You can then view your Saved Books queue by clicking on the button in the upper right corner.  This will pull up all your saved books and give you the option to delete as needed.

Technology: full mern stack using React, Mongo DB and Node.js / express.js server and API.
